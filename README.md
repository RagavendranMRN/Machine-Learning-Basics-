This repo is for "Machine Learning from very basics".

# Different Packages
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Scikit-learn
* matplotlib

# Let's look into the use of packages

#### Pandas
Pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive. 
The most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language

###### Main Features of Panda
* Easy handling of missing data 
* Columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame 
* Automatic and explicit data alignment: objects can be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels 
* Intuitive merging and joining data sets
* Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets
* Loading data from flat files (CSV and delimited), Excel files, databases, and saving/loading data

###### Documentation

The official documentation is hosted on PyData.org: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable

#### NumPy
NumPy is the fundamental package needed for scientific computing with Python.
The ndarray (NumPy Array) is a multidimensional array used to store values of same datatype. These arrays are indexed just like Sequences, starts with zero

###### Main Features of Panda
* A powerful N-Dimensional array
* Sophisticated Functions
* Mathematical and Logical opertions
* Fourier Transforms
* Linear Algebra, Random Number Generation
